  <h3>ABOUT THE GAME</h3>

  <p>the aim of the game is simple. try to guess <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearson_correlation_coefficient">how correlated the two<br>
  variables in a scatter plot are.</a> the closer your guess is to the<br> true correlation, the better.</p>

  <p>your guess should be between zero and one, where zero is no<br>
  correlation and one is perfect correlation. no negative<br>
  correlations are used in the game. here are some examples:</p>
  <img src="graphs.png" alt="graph de correlation">
  <p>guess the correlation is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human-based_computation_game">game with a purpose</a>. this means, while it<br>
  aims to be entertaining, data on the guesses is collected and used<br> to analyse how we perceive correlations in scatter plots. so the<br>
  more people that play, the more data is generated! </p>
  <h3>RULES</h3>
  <p>guess within 0.05 of the true correlation: +1 life and +5 coins<br>
  guess within 0.10 of the true correlation: +1 coin<br>
  guess within &gt;0.10 of the true correlation: -1 life</p>
  <p>you will also receive bonus coins if you make good guesses in a row! </p>
  <h3>ABOUT ME</h3>
  <p>i'm a phd student studying bioinformatics at the university of<br>
  cambridge and the european bioinformatics institute. this game is a<br> side project to feed one of my many day-to-day curiosities.<br>
  i'm always grateful for suggestions and happy to answer questions<br>
  about the game or how the data will be used. so tweet me at<br>
  <a href="https://twitter.com/omarwagih">@omarwagih</a> or <a href="mailto:omarwagih@gmail.com">email me.</a></p>
  <h3>USAGE DISCLAIMER AND PRIVACY STATEMENT</h3>
  <p>the analysis of the resulting data relies on true human guesses.<br>
  please don't go out of your way to repeatedly and systematically<br>
  guess the correct correlation (e.g. using bots). it takes away from<br>
  the enjoyment of other users by spamming the score board. it's also<br>
  easy to identify users that are doing this from the data and clear<br>
  their name from the score board. that being said, if you find a bug or<br>
  something does not work as expected, please do <a href="mailto:omarwagih@gmail.com">email me</a> so i can<br>
  sort it out. </p>
  <p>the following information will be automatically stored remotely<br>
  whenever you make a correlation guess: current date and time, ip<br>
  address and correlation data. this data is evaluated purely for<br>
  statistical purposes in an anonymised form. if you do not consent to<br>
  providing such information, or contributing data please refrain<br>
  from playing. for more information on how the data will be used, feel<br>
  free to <a href="mailto:omarwagih@gmail.com">email me</a></p>
